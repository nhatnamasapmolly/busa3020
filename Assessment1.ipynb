    "\n",
    "### Objective: \n",
    "- This assignment focuses on a dataset of Inventory dead stock.\n",
    "- The primary goal is to predict which stock items are likely to be dead (e.g. not used or moved in a long time) using various data mining methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background: \n",
    "A mid manufacturing retailer noticed that certain items in its warehouse across Australia had not moved for a number of months. These products included a number of products or materials stored or manufactured in the wharehouses. Despite being listed in the inventory system, they had no recent sales activity, were no longer featured in marketing campaigns, and had limited relevance to current customer needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inventory manager initiated a review to determine whether these items should be classified as dead stockâ€”inventory that is unlikely to be sold due to obsolescence, lack of demand, damage, or other reasons that can impact their classification. The classification would allow the company to make informed decisions about markdowns, liquidation, or disposal, and free up valuable warehouse space. This project aims to refine this classification by identifying stock items (and possibly their wharehouses locations) that are likely to be dead stock, enhancing the precision of wharhouse facility storage planning\n",
